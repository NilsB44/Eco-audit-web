# 🌍 Eco-audit Web: Strategic Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements for the Carbon Footprint Calculator web application.

## Phase 1: Enable Parallel Agents
*   **Git Worktrees for Frontend Scaling:** Implement git worktree support to allow concurrent development on different UI features (e.g., Calculator UI and Analytics Dashboard) by multiple agents.
*   **Optimized Build Pipeline:** Parallelize the Next.js build and linting processes in CI/CD.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Personalization
*   **User Profiles:** Add authentication to allow users to save and track their carbon footprint history.
*   **Localized Coefficients:** Dynamic adjustment of emission factors based on user location and local utility data.

## Phase 3: Data Visualization & Insights
*   **Impact Dashboards:** Integrate interactive charts to visualize the breakdown of carbon sources (transport, energy, etc.).
*   **AI-Powered Reduction Tips:** Provide personalized suggestions for reducing carbon footprint based on user data.
